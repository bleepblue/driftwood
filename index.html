                <p>Driftwood Troubadours are a song writing duo from Rowlands Castle on the Hampshire-West Sussex border.</p>
                <p>We perform only our own compositions, many of which tell stories in the tradition of travelling entertainers- 
                    hence "troubadours".</p>
                <p>Performances can take a traditional concert format, with short introductions to each song, but 
                    we specialise in presentations illustrated with projected images which we believe enhances the 
                    listening experience. This works well with groups and societies looking for something different 
                    from the usual talk for their regular meetings.</p>
